## Address Lookup & Search

| Feature | Endpoint / Location | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Address search | `GET /api/address` | `?street=&city=&state=&zip=&number=&limit=` |
| Address disambiguation | `GET /api/address` | Results scored + ranked by specificity; `match_type` field on each result |
| Fuzzy / typo-tolerant search | `GET /api/address?fuzzy=true` | Calls `findAddressFuzzy()` in query.js |
| Autocomplete / typeahead | `GET /api/suggest` | `?q=&state=&zip=&limit=` — 5-min TTL cache |
| Bulk address verify | `POST /api/address/bulk` | Array input, max 1,000 per request, synchronous |
| ZIP code lookup | `GET /api/zip/:zip` | Returns ZIP metadata |
| State summary | `GET /api/state/:code` | Address count + metadata + `coverage` + `coverage_source` per state |
| All states | `GET /api/states` | Sorted by address count |
| County lookup | `GET /api/county` | `?state=&name=` |
| City search | `GET /api/city` | `?state=&name=&county=&limit=` |
| Neighborhood list | `GET /api/neighborhood` | `?state=&city=&limit=` |
| ZIP codes in area | `GET /api/zips` | `?state=&city=&limit=` |
| Proximity search | `GET /api/near` | `?lat=&lon=&radius_km=&limit=` |

## Address Enrichment

Enrichments returned on **every** `/api/address` response (no extra call needed):

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `fips` | `countyFips()` in enrich.js | 5-digit county FIPS (state + county) |
| `confidence` | `confidenceScore()` in enrich.js | 0–100 reliability score |

| `neighborhood` | `enrich()` in enrich.js | `nbrhd_comm` or `uninc_comm` |
| `coverage` | `enrichAddress()` in web-server.js | `"full"` / `"gap-fill"` / `"partial"` — data source quality for this state |

## Billing & Subscription

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | req/day | req/min | Enrichment |
|------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| `free` | $0 | 1,000 | 10 | No |
| `starter` | $49/mo | 50,000 | 100 | No |
| `pro` | $249/mo | 500,000 | 1,000 | Yes |
| `metered` | pay-per-lookup | unlimited | 500 | No |
| `enterprise` | custom | unlimited | 9,999 | Yes |

### Stripe Integration (LIVE mode)

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | API key issued (or existing key upgraded); email sent via SendGrid |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Key tier synced to new plan — detects upgrade/downgrade by matching `price.id` to tier table |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Key downgraded to `free` |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Dunning email with link to update payment method (up to 4 attempts) |

### Checkout Flow

1. User POSTs to `POST /v1/checkout` with `{ email, tier }`
2. Server creates Stripe Checkout Session → returns `{ session_id, url }`
3. User completes payment on Stripe-hosted page
4. Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` webhook
5. Server issues / upgrades API key → sends key via SendGrid email
6. Frontend polls `GET /v1/checkout/session/:id` until `status: "complete"`

### Metered Billing Flow

1. Each address lookup increments `metered_unreported` on the key row
2. Server runs `runMeteredFlush()` daily at midnight UTC (self-scheduling `setTimeout`)
3. Flush fires `billing.meterEvents.create` for event `geoclear_lookup` per customer
4. Stripe aggregates usage and bills at month end
5. Manual flush available: `POST /v1/admin/metered/flush`

Live Stripe Billing Meter: `mtr_61UVWpc...` | Event name: `geoclear_lookup`

## API Key Management

| Feature | Endpoint | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|

| Paid tier checkout | `POST /v1/checkout` | Stripe-hosted checkout; `starter`, `pro`, `metered` |
| Poll for key post-payment | `GET /v1/checkout/session/:id` | Returns `status: pending | complete` + key |
| Key status & usage | `GET /v1/me` | Tier, limits, usage today / total |
| Rate limiting | per-key per-tier | `req_per_min` enforced via express-rate-limit |
| Daily quota | per-key per-tier | `req_per_day` enforced in auth middleware |
